After standardizing and merging all datasets into a single monthly file, we obtain the following dataset - Intermediate Files.csv
It has the following columns:
* Date
* Monthly_cases
* UNRATE
* Initial_claims
* continued_claims
* Covered_employment
* Insured_unemployment_rate
* Face_Masks_Required_in_Public


It is a monthly dataset with the incremental number of monthly cases as “monthly_cases”, and aggregated weekly UI claims as “initial_claims”
